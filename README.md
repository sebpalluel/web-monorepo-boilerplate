# Web monorepo boilerplate

## Project structure

- [**Hasura console**](http://localhost:9695/console)

The console is used as a backoffice to handle the graphQL server and to innerlink all the microservices.

- [**React Next app**](http://localhost:3000/)

This is the main web app client used to access the whole array of services.

### What's inside?

This repo uses [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager. It includes the following apps and libs:

#### Apps and Libs

- `web`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app
- `ui`: ui: a React component library
- `gql`: gql: a library containing all the GraphQL queries and mutations and the generated schemas to be used on the web app. It is divided on 3 folders: `user`, `admin` and `anonymous` depending of the role of the user.
- `logger`: Isomorphic logger (a small wrapper around console.log)

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Populate missing env variables

### Google OAuth provider

Follow [this tutorial from google](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en) to setup your own OAuth provider

Once retrieved your <mark>client id</mark> and <mark>client secret</mark> assign them in `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` located in the file `.env.local`

### JWT secret keys

In order to secure your JWT authentication provided by [Next Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) you are going to need to generate your own RSA-256 keys. Please refer to the section [Configure Hasura and Next Auth with same RSA key](#configure-hasura-and-next-auth-with-same-rsa-key)

### NX Cloud access tokens

As refered in the [section about access token in the nx doc,](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/account/access-tokens) you have different strategies to setup your access to [Nx Cloud](https://nx.app/). In order to beneficiate from local and remote cacheables operations, you can populate use this command to generate an access token allowing <mark>read-write</mark> access:

```shell
pnpx nx g @nrwl/nx-cloud:init
```

After that, you are going to need to [setup your workspace on the nx cloud](https://cloud.nx.app/orgs/workspace-setup) after registering an account.

## How to run the project ?

First you need to install pnpm in your machine.

```sh
npm install -g pnpm
```

Install all the dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

Then you can run the project.

```sh
pnpm start
```

### Docker

This repo is configured to be built with Docker, and Docker compose. To build all apps in this repo:

```sh
pnpm docker:build
```

To shutdown all running containers:

```sh
pnpm docker:stop
```

The command to run all the services and containers in this repo is

```sh
pnpm start
```

### Utilities

This repo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) test runner for all things JavaScript
- [Cypress]](<https://www.cypress.io/>) test runner for E2E and components test
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Configure Hasura and Next Auth with same RSA key

You need to configure hasura and next auth to have the same asymmetric key. One is provided by default but you can generate your own RSA 256 key using those commands:

```sh
# Don't add passphrase
ssh-keygen -t rsa -P "" -b 4096 -m PEM -f jwtRS256.key
ssh-keygen -e -m PEM -f jwtRS256.key > jwtRS256.key.pub
```

<https://hasura.io/blog/next-js-jwt-authentication-with-next-auth-and-integration-with-hasura/>

- Copy the public key in a single line format:

```sh
awk -v ORS='\\n' '1' jwtRS256.key.pub | pbcopy
```

- Now paste this value in your clipboard to `HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET` env in the format

```sh
{ "type": "RS256", "key": "<insert-your-public-key-here>"}
```

- Transform private key into a single line to copy to your clipboard to `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` env

```sh
awk -v ORS='\\n' '1' jwtRS256.key | pbcopy
```

Don't forget to add double quotes "" arround so that `\n` are interpreted correctly

## NX

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

### Categories of libraries

In a workspace, libraries are typically divided into four different types:

#### Feature

Libraries that implement ‚Äúsmart‚Äù UI (e.g. is effectful, is connected to data sources, handles routing, etc.) for specific business use cases.

#### UI

Libraries that contain only presentational components. That is, compo- nents that render purely from their props, and calls function handlers when interaction occurs.

#### Data-access

Libraries that contain the means for interacting with external data services; external services are typically backend services.

#### Utility

Libraries that contain common utilities that are shared by many projects.

### Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
- `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/web`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
- `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/node`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/community) you could add.

### Generate an application

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

### Generate a library

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@boilerplate-2/mylib`.

### Development server

Run `nx serve web` for a dev server. Navigate to <http://localhost:3000/>. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

### Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `nx e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

### Understand your workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
